# High Seas: Pixel Art Editor! ðŸŽ¨

Simple, but very nice pixel art editor made with **HTML**, **JS** and **Tailwind CSS** only! <br><br>
**I set a goal to do it in the most basic technologies possible, which I think I accomplished.**

**Demo:** [Here](https://ondrejpacovsky.cz/demo/highseas/PixelArtEditor/index.html)

**Features:** Preset colors, hex & rgb supported, clearing the entire canvas and also saving as picture to your device! <br>
